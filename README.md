# CityCentreVehicleGarage
Overview
This project is a web-based platform developed for a city centre vehicle garage that provides MOT testing, repairs, and general vehicle services. The website supports three types of users:
Customers, who can obtain service quotations and book appointments
Mechanics, who can manage and display their availability
Admin, who handles customer messages and enquiries

The aim of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to analyse requirements, design, implement, and test an interactive front-end website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

Testing
The website was tested using the following methods:
Unit Testing:
Individual components such as forms, inputs, and validation logic were tested for correct functionality.
Integration Testing:
Verified interactions between front-end pages and back-end scripts (e.g., form submission, login processes).
System Testing:
Complete user workflows (e.g., from customer booking to admin response) were tested to ensure consistency and functionality throughout the site.
